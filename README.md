Small tool, written in C#, to clean unused elements from beatmaps.
Originally created by [henntix](https://github.com/henntix/osu-cleaner), but completely reskinned, revamped, branded and updated by [TechNobo](https://tcno.co)

Lots of changes and improvements since the original 1.0 henntix release. Enjoy the revamped software!

If you are using a SSD, you will be happy! Deleting those elements will save your disk space even by few gigabytes. You can choose what to delete: videos, storyboards, beatmap skins, backgrounds and hitsounds. You can also choose to move those files instead of permanent purge.

## Known Issues
* (Since 1.0) Some storyboard elements are not deleted due to not being used on actual storyboard. This cannot be easily fixed due to storyboard elements finding approach. This issue could be fixed by implementing *"unused elements cleaner"* which will delete all files except \*osu, audio files and whitelisted elements mentioned above, selected by user
* (Since 1.0) \*.osb files are not deleted.
